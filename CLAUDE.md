# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

"stringr" - A Tennis Stringer's Notebook mobile app built with React Native/Expo and PocketBase backend. Allows tennis players and stringers to track racquets, string jobs, and string characteristics. Future features include sound-based tension analysis.

## Development Commands

**Project Setup:**
```bash
# Install task runner first: https://taskfile.dev
cd stringr
task install       # Install all dependencies
task dev           # Start both frontend and backend
task dev:ui        # Start only React Native web server
task dev:backend   # Start only PocketBase server
```

**Legacy Commands (still work):**
```bash
cd stringr         # Frontend directory
npm start          # Start Expo dev server
npm run web        # Run in web browser
npm test           # Run Jest tests
```

**PocketBase Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
./pocketbase serve --dev --dir ~/.stringr  # Manual start
task backend:admin # Create admin user
```

**Git Workflow:**
- Use `npm` for package management
- Commit frequently at logical stopping points
- Push to remote after major milestones
- All PocketBase data stored in ~/.stringr (outside repo)

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo Router
- **Backend**: PocketBase (SQLite-based BaaS)
- **Database**: SQLite via PocketBase
- **Navigation**: File-based routing with tabs
- **Theming**: Built-in light/dark mode support
- **Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library

## Architecture Notes

**App Structure:**
- Tab-based navigation: Racquets, String Jobs, Strings, Profile
- Modal overlays for forms and detailed views
- Theme-aware components with automatic dark mode

**Data Models (Implemented):**
- Users (authentication with name, email, avatar)
- Racquets (name, brand, model, pattern, weight, notes, year)
- Strings (brand, model, material, gauge, color, user attribution)
- String Jobs (racquet, main/cross strings, tension_lbs_main/cross)
- Sessions (string_job, duration_hours, rating, string_broken tracking)

**Development Phases:**
1. âœ… Project setup and foundation (COMPLETED)
2. âœ… Navigation and basic screens (COMPLETED)
3. âœ… PocketBase backend setup (COMPLETED)
4. âœ… Database schema and API integration (COMPLETED)
5. âœ… Authentication and user management (COMPLETED)
6. ðŸ”„ Core CRUD functionality (IN PROGRESS)
7. ðŸ“¸ Media/photo features
8. ðŸ”Š Audio processing foundation

## Current Project Status

**âœ… Completed (Phase 1-5):**
- React Native/Expo project with TypeScript and 4-tab navigation
- PocketBase v0.23.6 backend with production-ready database schema
- Complete API client with TypeScript interfaces for all collections
- Task-based development workflow (Taskfile.yml) with functional task runner
- 4 PocketBase collections: racquets, strings, string_jobs, sessions
- User-scoped security rules and proper data relationships
- Authentication system with login/register screens and protected routes
- SharedStyles system for consistent UI patterns across the app
- AuthContext for centralized user session and state management
- Web testing available at http://localhost:8081
- PocketBase admin at http://localhost:8090/_/ with schema import ready
- Tennis strings scraper script with comprehensive database (200+ strings)

**âœ… Completed (Phase 5):**
- Authentication screens with login/register forms and validation
- AuthContext for centralized user session management  
- Protected routes that redirect to login when unauthenticated
- Profile screen with user info display and logout functionality
- Consistent authentication state management across navigation

**ðŸ”„ Current Phase (Phase 6):**
- Core CRUD functionality for racquets, string jobs, and sessions
- Data entry forms and list views for all tennis collections
- Integration with PocketBase API for full data persistence

**ðŸ“‹ Next Features (Phase 7-8):**
- Photo/image support for racquet documentation
- Advanced filtering, search, and data visualization
- Sound-based tension analysis (future research phase)

## Expo Router Concepts

- **File-based routing**: Similar to SvelteKit, files in `app/` become routes
- **Route groups**: `(tabs)` - parentheses don't affect URL structure
- **Layouts**: `_layout.tsx` files provide shared UI/logic
- **Stack vs Tabs**: Stack = push/pop navigation, Tabs = bottom navigation

## PocketBase Backend Details

**Server Configuration:**
- Data directory: `~/.stringr/pb_data/`
- Admin interface: http://localhost:8090/_/
- API endpoint: http://localhost:8090/api/
- Development mode: Enabled with SQL logging

**System Collections:**
- `users`: User authentication with profiles (name, email, avatar)
- `_superusers`: Admin users for backend management
- System collections for auth, MFA, external auth, password resets

**Tennis Collections (Production Ready):**
- `racquets`: User's racquets (name required, brand, model, pattern, weight, notes)
- `strings`: Shared string database (model required, brand, material, gauge, color)
- `string_jobs`: String installations (racquet, main/cross strings, tensions in lbs)
- `sessions`: Performance tracking (duration, rating, string breakage per string job)

**Schema Import:**
- Complete schema available in `backend/stringr_schemas.json`
- 30-second import: Admin â†’ Settings â†’ Import collections
- Includes proper security rules and field constraints
- Ready for production use with user data isolation

## API Client Features

**TypeScript Integration (lib/pocketbase.ts):**
- Complete type definitions for all collections
- Authentication helpers (login, register, logout, session management)
- CRUD operations for racquets, strings, string_jobs, sessions
- Relationship expansion and filtering
- Search functionality for strings
- User-scoped data access

**Available API Functions:**
- `auth.login()`, `auth.register()`, `auth.getCurrentUser()`
- `api.racquets.list()`, `api.racquets.create()`, etc.
- `api.strings.search()`, `api.strings.list()`
- `api.stringJobs.getByRacquet()`, `api.stringJobs.create()`
- `api.sessions.getByStringJob()`, `api.sessions.create()`

## Scripts and Utilities

**String Database Scraper (`scripts/scrape_strings.py`):**
- Scrapes Tennis Warehouse comprehensive string database
- Extracts brand, model, material, gauge, and performance characteristics
- Generates timestamped JSON files for PocketBase import
- Over 200 tennis strings with detailed specifications
- Usage: `cd scripts && python3 scrape_strings.py`
- Dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

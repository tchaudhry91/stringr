## Development Commands

**Project Setup:**
```bash
# Install task runner first: https://taskfile.dev
cd stringr
task install       # Install all dependencies
task dev           # Start both frontend and backend
task dev:ui        # Start only React Native web server
task dev:backend   # Start only PocketBase server
```

**Legacy Commands (still work):**
```bash
cd stringr         # Frontend directory
npm start          # Start Expo dev server
npm run web        # Run in web browser
npm test           # Run Jest tests
```

**PocketBase Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
./pocketbase serve --dev --dir ~/.stringr  # Manual start
task backend:admin # Create admin user
```

**Git Workflow:**
- Use `npm` for package management
- Commit frequently at logical stopping points
- Push to remote after major milestones
- All PocketBase data stored in ~/.stringr (outside repo)

## Technology Stack

- **Improved Headers**: Fixed navigation titles showing proper "Racquet Details" instead of raw route names
- **Rating Display**: Simplified rating display without "/5" suffix for cleaner UI

**üêõ Recent Bug Fixes:**
- **‚úÖ String Selection Bug**: Fixed form state management issues during string job creation by redesigning modal architecture
  - **Solution**: Replaced separate modal routes with internal view switching to prevent form state loss
  - **Files fixed**: `app/string-job-modal.tsx` (redesigned), `app/string-picker-modal.tsx` (removed)
  - **Improvements**: Proper navigation, no URL parameter chaos, maintains form state consistency
- **‚úÖ Delete Functionality**: Fixed string job deletion not working in web browsers
  - **Solution**: Platform-specific confirmations (browser `confirm()` for web, React Native Alert for mobile)
  - **Files fixed**: `app/(tabs)/jobs.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` (signout fix)
- **‚úÖ Session Display**: Enhanced session creation to show both main and cross strings when available
  - **Files improved**: `app/session-modal.tsx` with intelligent string display logic

**üé® UI/UX Improvements (Latest):**
- **‚úÖ Card Styling Overhaul**: Improved mobile experience with better borders and contrast
  - **Thinner borders**: Reduced from 1px to 0.5px for cleaner appearance
  - **Better contrast**: Increased text opacity (0.7‚Üí0.8, 0.6‚Üí0.7) for improved readability
  - **Enhanced dark mode**: Better background colors (#1c1c1e) and theme-aware borders
  - **Mobile optimization**: Larger margins, touch targets, and spacing for mobile devices
  - **Files updated**: `styles/SharedStyles.ts`, all card-based screens
- **‚úÖ Dark Mode Fixes**: Fixed racquet details card display issues in Expo Go
  - **Solution**: Added transparent backgrounds to inner View components for proper theme inheritance
  - **Files fixed**: `app/racquet/[id].tsx` with proper theme-aware styling
- **‚úÖ Action Button Consistency**: Added missing buttons and standardized styling
  - **Added**: Edit/Delete buttons to racquet listing cards (were missing functionality)
  - **Fixed**: String jobs delete button styling to match other cards
  - **Consistent**: All cards now use identical button row styling and theming

**üìã Next Features (Phase 9-10):**
- String Job editing functionality with string/tension updates
- Photo/image support for racquet documentation
- Advanced data visualization and performance analytics
- Enhanced filtering, search, and sorting capabilities
- Sound-based tension analysis (future research phase)

## Expo Router Concepts

- **File-based routing**: Similar to SvelteKit, files in `app/` become routes
- **Route groups**: `(tabs)` - parentheses don't affect URL structure
- **Layouts**: `_layout.tsx` files provide shared UI/logic
- **Stack vs Tabs**: Stack = push/pop navigation, Tabs = bottom navigation
